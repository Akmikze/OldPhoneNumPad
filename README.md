# Description of the problem

As you can see this is an Old Phone Key Pad with **Alphabetical Letters**, **Backspace**, **Space**, **Special Characters or Symbols** and a **Send Button**.

Each button is identified by a number and by pressing it we must cycle through them in order to write the letter or symbol needed so this means it needs to be pressed multiple times.

For example: 

Pressing **2** once is gonna end up showing **A**. That means: **2# = A**. 

On the other han pressing twice the number **2** is gonna generate a **B** in this case **22# = B**.

One of the requirements for this challenge is that you **must** pause for a second in order to type two characters from the same button after each other. 

Here is an Example of it: **222 2 22#** = **CAB** As you can see here spaces are not counted and the message is not show as **C A B** this is because the space is the equivalent of an right arrow you could use the **0** between those spaces like this **222020200#** but you'll generate this instead **C A B**.

The other requirement for this challenge is that you **must** end every message with **#**
